A few years ago, I was leading a backend team for a financial services company. One afternoon, we received a critical
bug alert — user account balances were being updated, but transaction logs were sometimes missing. On debugging, we
realized that some database operations were failing silently due to unchecked exceptions, and Spring's `@Transactional`
annotation wasn't capturing them as expected.

It was a hard lesson in how annotations can abstract too much — sometimes at the cost of fine-grained control. That's
when we discovered the power of Spring's `TransactionTemplate` to programmatically manage transactions, giving us both
flexibility and control.

## Problem

Declarative transaction management in Spring using `@Transactional` is convenient but not always sufficient:

* You can’t easily manage transactions across multiple methods or classes without complex refactoring.
* Exception handling can be tricky. Some runtime exceptions don’t trigger rollback as expected.
* When working with legacy code, non-Spring managed beans, or integrating third-party libraries, annotations are not
  viable.
* Dynamic transactional behavior based on conditions is hard to implement with annotations.

These limitations led us to explore programmatic transaction management using `TransactionTemplate`.

## Solution: Enter `TransactionTemplate`

Spring’s `TransactionTemplate` provides an imperative approach to manage transactions. It works by executing a lambda or
a callback within a transaction boundary.

### Key Advantages

* Complete control over commit/rollback.
* Flexibility in integrating with legacy code.
* Can be used for conditional or nested transactional flows.
* Works without annotations — suitable for non-Spring components.

## Detailed Examples

### 1. Basic Usage of `TransactionTemplate`

```java

@Service
public class AccountService {

    private final TransactionTemplate transactionTemplate;
    private final AccountRepository accountRepository;

    public AccountService(PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager, AccountRepository accountRepository) {
        this.transactionTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
        this.accountRepository = accountRepository;
    }

    public void transferAmount(Long fromId, Long toId, BigDecimal amount) {
        transactionTemplate.execute(status -> {
            Account from = accountRepository.findById(fromId).orElseThrow();
            Account to = accountRepository.findById(toId).orElseThrow();

            from.debit(amount);
            to.credit(amount);

            accountRepository.save(from);
            accountRepository.save(to);

            return null;
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Handling Rollback Programmatically

```java
transactionTemplate.execute(status ->{
        try {
            // business logic
        } catch(SomeBusinessException ex){
          status.setRollbackOnly();
          throw ex;
        }
        return null;
});
```

### 3. Custom Transaction Propagation & Isolation

```java
TransactionTemplate customTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
customTemplate.setPropagationBehavior(TransactionDefinition.PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW);
customTemplate.setIsolationLevel(TransactionDefinition.ISOLATION_SERIALIZABLE);

customTemplate.execute(status -> {
        // critical isolated logic
        return null;
});
```

### 4. Nested Transactions (Simulated)

```java
public void outerMethod() {
    transactionTemplate.execute(status -> {
        // outer logic
        innerMethod();
        return null;
    });
}

private void innerMethod() {
    TransactionTemplate nestedTemplate = new TransactionTemplate(transactionManager);
    nestedTemplate.setPropagationBehavior(TransactionDefinition.PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW);

    nestedTemplate.execute(status -> {
        // inner logic
        return null;
    });
}
```

### 5. Using `TransactionCallbackWithoutResult`

```java
transactionTemplate.execute(new TransactionCallbackWithoutResult() {
    @Override
    protected void doInTransactionWithoutResult (TransactionStatus status){
        // business logic without return
    }
});
```

## Best Practices

* **Use `TransactionTemplate` when declarative transactions fall short** — e.g., in condition-based logic, legacy
  integration, or when annotations can't be used.
* **Always set rollback rules explicitly** in catch blocks.
* **Prefer lambdas** for readability unless return is needed.
* **Encapsulate transaction boundaries** to make the code more testable and reusable.
* **Log rollback reasons** to simplify debugging.
* **Use `PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW` carefully**, especially in nested flows to avoid deadlocks or unwanted isolation
  behavior.

## Anti-Patterns

* **Wrapping everything in `TransactionTemplate` unnecessarily** — use it only when fine-grained control is needed.
* **Catching all exceptions without rethrowing** — this can lead to transaction committing despite errors.
* **Mixing declarative and programmatic transaction management** in a confusing or inconsistent way.
* **Handling transactions deep in utility/helper classes** — keep transaction logic in service or boundary layers.

## Final Thoughts

`TransactionTemplate` isn’t meant to replace `@Transactional`, but it is a powerful alternative when things get complex.
When used correctly, it allows you to control every aspect of your transaction lifecycle. This makes it a great tool for
building reliable and fault-tolerant enterprise systems.

In our incident, switching to `TransactionTemplate` helped us detect failures early, rollback appropriately, and log
every failed step — all without rewriting large parts of our codebase.

## Summary

* `@Transactional` is convenient but limited in some cases.
* `TransactionTemplate` offers programmatic control.
* It’s suitable for conditional logic, legacy code, and complex workflows.
* Use it wisely with clear rollback, isolation, and propagation strategies.
* Avoid overusing it where declarative is sufficient.

Happy coding :grinning:
