It was 2 AM, and our team was battling the production server. A last-minute patch had broken the payment workflow. Our
lead developer sighed, "If only we had time to refactor this part." We all knew what the problem was: years of ignored
shortcuts, quick fixes, and code that was "just good enough". We were living with *technical debt*—and the interest was
due.

If you're a Java Spring Boot developer, chances are you've faced similar situations. You needed to ship fast, made
compromises, and now you're spending more time debugging than building. Let’s explore how to manage technical debt at
multiple levels.

## Problem: What is Technical Debt and Why It Hurts

Technical debt refers to the cost of choosing an easy or limited solution now instead of using a better, often more
time-consuming approach. Like financial debt, it accumulates interest—in the form of:

* Slower feature delivery
* More bugs
* Poor maintainability
* Higher onboarding time for new developers
* Team frustration and burnout

### Types of Technical Debt:

1. **Deliberate Debt**: "We'll fix it later."
2. **Accidental Debt**: Caused by lack of knowledge.
3. **Bit Rot**: Code that decays over time without maintenance.
4. **Process Debt**: Inefficient or missing workflows.

Technical debt exists at many levels:

* **Code-level**: Poor naming, duplication, large classes
* **Design-level**: Inflexible architecture, lack of boundaries
* **Testing-level**: Missing or flaky tests
* **Infrastructure-level**: Manual deployment, outdated libraries

## Solution: A Mindset and Discipline Shift

Technical debt isn’t inherently evil. Like a loan, it can be strategic—if managed. The key is to:

* Identify it early
* Track it intentionally
* Prioritize its repayment
* Refactor incrementally
* Balance delivery and quality

For Java Spring Boot developers, you can embed this mindset into:

* CI/CD pipelines
* Pull request reviews
* Sprint planning and retrospectives

## Multiple Examples and Explanations

### 1. Code-Level Debt: The God Class

```java

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/orders")
public class OrderController {
    @Autowired
    OrderService service;

    @PostMapping
    public ResponseEntity<Order> placeOrder(@RequestBody Order order) {
        // logic for validation, pricing, discount, loyalty, payment
        return ResponseEntity.ok(order);
    }
}
```

**Problem**: Controller is doing too much. Violation of SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).

**Refactor**:

* Move pricing, loyalty, and payment to separate services.
* Use `@Component` or `@Service` beans for each.
* Use DTOs for clean separation.

### 2. Design-Level Debt: Tight Coupling Between Modules

```java
public class InvoiceService {
    private final CustomerRepository customerRepo;
    private final OrderRepository orderRepo;
}
```

**Problem**: Service depends on two repositories directly; change in one breaks the other.

**Refactor**:

* Introduce a façade layer or anti-corruption layer.
* Use events or interfaces to decouple services.

### 3. Testing-Level Debt: No Tests for Business Logic

**Problem**: Only controller tests exist. Business rules are not unit tested.

**Refactor**:

* Extract business logic to services.
* Write JUnit/Mockito tests for services.

```java

@Test
void apply_discount_for_loyal_customer() {
    Customer c = new Customer("gold");
    BigDecimal discounted = discountService.calculate(c, new BigDecimal("100"));
    assertThat(discounted).isEqualByComparingTo("90.00");
}
```

### 4. Infrastructure-Level Debt: Manual Deployment

**Problem**: Builds are deployed manually, taking hours and error-prone.

**Refactor**:

* Use GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD for automation.
* Containerize with Docker.
* Define environments clearly (`application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`).

## Best Practices

1. **Track Technical Debt**

    * Add TODOs with comments like `// DEBT: refactor this to avoid tight coupling`
    * Use tools like SonarQube or CodeScene

2. **Set Refactoring Time**

    * Allocate 10–20% of each sprint for refactoring or cleanup

3. **Use Code Reviews for Debt Detection**

    * Check for large methods, unclear names, magic numbers, duplication

4. **Test Before Refactor**

    * Ensure there are tests before refactoring to avoid regressions

5. **Document Trade-offs**

    * Log intentional debt in sprint notes with context

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Refactor Without Tests**

    * Leads to regressions and wasted effort

2. **The Never-Ending TODO**

    * Commented debt without tracking means it gets lost forever

3. **All-Or-Nothing Refactor**

    * Trying to clean everything at once often leads to abandonment

4. **Ignoring Legacy Code**

    * "It works, don’t touch it" mindset leads to rot

5. **Blame Game**

    * Blaming past developers instead of improving the code helps no one

## Final Thoughts

Technical debt is part of software life. But like financial debt, the goal is to keep it under control and repay it
strategically. By embedding debt management into your development culture, you make your codebase healthier and your
team happier.

Technical debt isn’t just bad code—it’s an opportunity to grow, to write better systems, and to learn discipline as a
developer.

## Summary

* Technical debt exists at multiple levels: code, design, testing, infra
* Not all debt is bad; unmanaged debt is
* Use intentional tracking, incremental refactoring, and CI discipline
* Examples show practical refactors in Spring Boot
* Avoid anti-patterns like untested refactors or ignored TODOs
