It was a typical Friday evening at our office. We were deploying a new version of our Spring Boot-based microservice
that interacts with a PostgreSQL database using Spring Data JPA. Everything had passed the CI pipeline, and our test
cases looked rock solid. But as soon as the application hit staging, we noticed something strange â€” the logs indicated
rollback behavior that was unexpected, and we werenâ€™t quite sure why.

We had no exceptions, no obvious failures, and yet transactions were being rolled back.

After hours of investigation, we discovered the root of the issue: we werenâ€™t logging our JPA transactions effectively,
and as a result, we couldnâ€™t trace the lifecycle of our transactions. This led us down the rabbit hole of understanding
and configuring `JpaTransactionManager` logging in Spring Boot.

## Problem: The Silent Failing Transactions

Spring Boot hides a lot of the internal transaction management logic under the hood. While this abstraction is great for
productivity, it becomes a hurdle during debugging if not properly configured.

Here's what commonly goes wrong:

* You donâ€™t see when a transaction starts or ends.
* You donâ€™t know whether a transaction was committed or rolled back.
* Youâ€™re unaware of nested transactions or propagation behavior.
* Exception stack traces donâ€™t always indicate a transactional failure.

These missing pieces make troubleshooting a nightmare.

## Solution: Enable and Understand `JpaTransactionManager` Logging

The Spring framework uses `PlatformTransactionManager` and specifically `JpaTransactionManager` when JPA is in use.

To gain visibility into transactions, you need to enable DEBUG logging for specific Spring transaction classes.

### Enable Logging

```properties
# application.properties or application.yml
logging.level.org.springframework.orm.jpa=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.transaction=DEBUG
```

This enables logs for the following internal classes:

* `org.springframework.transaction.support.AbstractPlatformTransactionManager`
* `org.springframework.orm.jpa.JpaTransactionManager`

Youâ€™ll start seeing logs like:

```shell
Creating new transaction with name [com.example.MyService.saveData]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT
Opened new EntityManager [SessionImpl] for JPA transaction
Initiating transaction commit
Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager [SessionImpl]
Closing JPA EntityManager [SessionImpl] after transaction
```

## Multiple Examples with Detailed Explanation

### Example 1: Simple Service Method

```java

@Service
public class UserService {

    @Transactional
    public void createUser(User user) {
        userRepository.save(user);
    }
}
```

**Log Output:**

```shell
Creating new transaction with name [com.example.UserService.createUser]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT
Opened new EntityManager for JPA transaction
Committing JPA transaction
Closed JPA EntityManager after transaction
```

You can trace transaction start, commit, and EntityManager lifecycle.

### Example 2: Rollback on Exception

```java

@Transactional
public void createUserWithError(User user) {
    userRepository.save(user);
    throw new RuntimeException("Intentional error");
}
```

**Log Output:**

```shell
Initiating transaction rollback
Rolling back JPA transaction on EntityManager
Closed JPA EntityManager after transaction
```

Spring automatically rolls back on unchecked exceptions.

### Example 3: Propagation Behavior

```java

@Service
public class OuterService {

    @Autowired
    private InnerService innerService;

    @Transactional
    public void outerMethod() {
        innerService.innerMethod();
    }
}

@Service
public class InnerService {

    @Transactional(propagation = Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW)
    public void innerMethod() {
        // new transaction
    }
}
```

**Log Output:**

```shell
Creating new transaction with name [com.example.OuterService.outerMethod]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED
Suspending current transaction
Creating new transaction with name [com.example.InnerService.innerMethod]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRES_NEW
Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager
Resuming suspended transaction
Committing JPA transaction on EntityManager
```

Shows how Spring handles multiple propagation types.

### Example 4: Read-Only Transactions

```java

@Transactional(readOnly = true)
public List<User> fetchUsers() {
    return userRepository.findAll();
}
```

**Log Output:**

```shell
Creating new transaction with name [com.example.UserService.fetchUsers]: PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,ISOLATION_DEFAULT,readOnly
```

While read-only does not change database behavior in most cases, itâ€™s respected in transaction definitions and can
optimize certain providers.

## Best Practices

* Always enable DEBUG logging for transaction packages in staging environments.
* Use `@Transactional` only at the service layer, not in DAOs or controllers.
* Wrap all database-modifying operations in a transaction.
* Avoid silent exception swallowing which can mask transaction rollbacks.
* Combine logs with correlation IDs for better traceability.
* Use `TransactionSynchronizationManager` to inspect transaction status programmatically if needed.

## Anti-Patterns

* **Logging only at ERROR level:** Misses important transaction lifecycle information.
* **Transactional on private methods:** Spring AOP wonâ€™t proxy them, so transactions won't be applied.
* **Mixing transaction management with business logic:** Leads to complex and fragile code.
* **Nested `@Transactional` with wrong propagation:** Can cause unexpected rollbacks or commits.
* **Ignoring checked exceptions:** These do not trigger rollback by default.

## Final Thoughts

Understanding what `JpaTransactionManager` is doing behind the scenes can significantly improve the reliability and
debuggability of your application. Transaction logs act as your eyes into how the persistence layer is behaving. Instead
of guessing why data is not saved or rolled back, logs tell you the whole story.

Make logging part of your transaction monitoring strategy â€” itâ€™s cheap and invaluable.

## Summary

* `JpaTransactionManager` is used in Spring Boot for managing transactions with JPA.
* DEBUG logging for `org.springframework.transaction` and `org.springframework.orm.jpa` reveals transaction lifecycle.
* Use `@Transactional` wisely with proper propagation and isolation.
* Logs help identify rollback issues, nested transaction problems, and propagation quirks.
