In the world of software development, we strive to write code that’s clean, modular, and easy to maintain. However, one
of the most common pitfalls developers fall into is creating **"God Classes"** — classes that try to do everything and
end up being bloated, unreadable, and error-prone. This blog explores the God Class code smell in the context of a
typical Java Spring Boot application and how to refactor it using clean architecture and principles from *Clean Code*.

## 1) Problem

A **God Class** violates the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** by handling too many concerns. It usually
contains business logic, data access code, input validation, data transformation, and even orchestration logic — all
jammed into a single class.  
This leads to:

- Poor readability and testability
- High coupling and low cohesion
- Difficulties in refactoring or adding new features
- Risk of introducing bugs when modifying unrelated functionality

## 2) Solution

To address this smell:

- **Identify the responsibilities** handled by the God Class.
- **Extract responsibilities** into separate classes/services (e.g., validators, transformers, repository, etc.).
- **Apply SRP**, the **Facade** or **Strategy Pattern**, and principles from **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** to break
  down monoliths.
- Use **constructor-based dependency injection** to maintain testability and modularity.

## 3) Examples

### Before Refactoring (God Class Smell)

```java

@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public void registerUser(UserDTO userDTO) {
        // Validate input
        if (userDTO.getEmail() == null || !userDTO.getEmail().contains("@")) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid email");
        }

        // Transform DTO to entity
        User user = new User();
        user.setName(userDTO.getName());
        user.setEmail(userDTO.getEmail());

        // Save user
        userRepository.save(user);

        // Send welcome email
        sendEmail(user.getEmail(), "Welcome to our platform!");
    }

    private void sendEmail(String email, String message) {
        // Sending logic here
    }
}
```

This class:

- Validates data
- Transforms DTO
- Saves to DB
- Sends emails

**Too much responsibility in one place.**

### After Refactoring (Clean & Modular)

```java

@Service
public class UserService {

    private final UserValidator validator;
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    private final EmailService emailService;
    private final UserMapper userMapper;

    public UserService(UserValidator validator,
                       UserRepository userRepository,
                       EmailService emailService,
                       UserMapper userMapper) {
        this.validator = validator;
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
        this.userMapper = userMapper;
    }

    public void registerUser(UserDTO userDTO) {
        validator.validate(userDTO);
        User user = userMapper.toEntity(userDTO);
        userRepository.save(user);
        emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(user.getEmail());
    }
}
```

Now:

- Validation is in `UserValidator`
- Transformation is in `UserMapper`
- Email sending is in `EmailService`

**Each class has one responsibility, making the system modular and testable.**

## 4) Summary

The **God Class** smell is dangerous because it centralizes too much logic, making it a bottleneck for development. By
breaking down such classes using SRP and other refactoring techniques, we create a more maintainable, scalable, and
test-friendly codebase.

## 5) Final Thoughts

Start small — identify a bloated service class in your Spring Boot app and extract just one responsibility into its own
class. Even gradual refactoring can yield huge benefits in readability and maintainability. Follow the *Clean Code*
principle: **“Functions should do one thing. They should do it well. They should do it only.”**

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.

Happy refactoring :grinning:
