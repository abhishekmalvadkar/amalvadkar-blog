It was a regular Thursday afternoon when I found myself buried under legacy code that looked like it had survived
multiple developers, several frameworks, and possibly the Y2K bug. As a senior Java developer working on a high-impact
module, I was tasked with fixing a simple bug—but each line I touched felt like pulling a thread from an old sweater. I
feared the whole thing might unravel. Frustrated, I decided to take a step back and approach the problem differently.

That’s when I opened up IntelliJ IDEA's **Refactor** menu.

I had been using IntelliJ for years but realized I hadn’t fully explored its arsenal of refactoring tools. From simple
renames to structural code transformations, IntelliJ offered powerful ways to clean, improve, and future-proof my code
without breaking functionality.

From that day, I started documenting each refactoring tool I used. This blog series is that logbook, curated to help
others navigate and master the refactoring capabilities in IntelliJ IDEA.

So let’s dive in and explore one refactoring technique at a time.

we will learn each refactoring technique in this fashion

> what it does, how to use it in IntelliJ IDEA, when to use it, and a sample before-after code

## Refactoring Techniques

### 1. Quick Fix and Suggestions with `Alt + Enter`

One of the most commonly used and versatile refactoring shortcuts in IntelliJ IDEA is `Alt + Enter`. It's not a single
refactoring technique but a gateway to dozens of context-aware suggestions IntelliJ provides while you're coding.

#### What It Does

When you place the cursor on a highlighted code issue or anywhere IntelliJ detects an improvement opportunity, pressing
`Alt + Enter` opens a context menu. This menu offers quick-fix suggestions, code intentions, and refactoring options
relevant to that piece of code.

#### How to Use It in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Place the caret on the code line with a warning, error, or suggestion.
2. Press `Alt + Enter` (or `Option + Enter` on macOS).
3. Choose from the list of available intentions.
4. IntelliJ applies the fix or opens a dialog to guide you through the refactoring.

#### When to Use It

* To fix compilation errors or warnings quickly.
* To convert between loops and streams.
* To add missing methods, constructors, or fields.
* To optimize imports or simplify expressions.
* To perform inline or extract method refactoring.

#### Sample Example

Before pressing `Alt + Enter`:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList(); // warning: raw type
```

After choosing "Add type arguments":

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
```

Another example—missing method:

```java
calculateTax(order); // Method doesn't exist yet
```

`Alt + Enter` → "Create method 'calculateTax'"

IntelliJ auto-generates:

```java
private void calculateTax(Order order) {
    // TODO: implement
}
```

This shortcut speeds up development and encourages cleaner, more accurate code with minimal effort.

You can read more about this in the official JetBrains documentation:

## Final Thoughts

Let me end with a quick story on why this list will always be a work in progress.

Every time I revisit legacy code or build a new feature, I encounter opportunities to refactor—sometimes small renames,
other times architectural changes. These moments teach me something new. Sometimes it's a shortcut key I didn't know
IntelliJ IDEA had, other times it's a smarter approach to breaking down complex logic.

Instead of keeping these lessons to myself, I decided to grow this blog incrementally. With each new discovery, I'll
update this list. Think of it as a living guide—a growing toolbox shaped by real-world experience, mistakes, and
continuous learning.

So if you're reading this months later, know that what you see is not the final form. It evolves just like our code
should.

Stay tuned for continuous improvements.
