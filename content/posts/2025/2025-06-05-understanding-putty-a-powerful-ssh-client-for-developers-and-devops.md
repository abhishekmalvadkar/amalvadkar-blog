It was a late night in our DevOps team's war room. A critical production bug needed immediate access to a legacy
application running on a VM in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Our Jenkins job was stuck, and none of the automated
workflows were helping. That’s when one of our senior engineers calmly pulled out PuTTY, connected to the GCP instance
via SSH, debugged live logs, and fixed the issue—all within minutes. This was my first exposure to the power and
simplicity of PuTTY.

## Problem

As developers or system administrators, we often need to remotely connect to servers—whether for debugging, deploying,
or managing applications. However, doing this securely and efficiently, especially from Windows machines, can be
challenging without the right tools. Many new developers struggle with:

* No built-in SSH client on Windows (pre-Windows 10)
* Complex CLI tools
* Managing private/public keys
* Transferring files over SSH

## Solution

**PuTTY** solves these challenges elegantly. It is a free, open-source terminal emulator, serial console, and network
file transfer application that supports various protocols such as SSH, Telnet, SCP, rlogin, and raw socket.

PuTTY provides a user-friendly interface for:

* Secure SSH connections
* Generating SSH keys (PuTTYgen)
* Managing session profiles
* Transferring files (with pscp and WinSCP)

It is especially handy on Windows machines that don’t come with a native SSH client pre-installed.

## Multiple Example in Detailed Fashion with Explanation

### 1. Connecting to a GCP Instance

**Steps:**

1. Download the private key (`.ppk` format) from GCP or convert it using PuTTYgen.
2. Open PuTTY.
3. In the **Host Name**, enter: `username@external-ip`.
4. In **Connection > SSH > Auth**, browse and load the `.ppk` file.
5. Save the session and click **Open**.

✅ Boom—you are now inside a live GCP instance!

### 2. Connecting to AWS EC2 Instance

**Steps:**

1. Convert `.pem` to `.ppk` using PuTTYgen.
2. Follow similar steps as GCP.
3. Login using `ec2-user@<public-ip>` or another user depending on the AMI.

### 3. Accessing Jenkins Shell Executor Host

When your Jenkins master executes shell commands on a build server, you might need manual SSH access to debug.

**Steps:**

* Use PuTTY to connect using the SSH credentials.
* View logs, running processes, or even restart agents.

### 4. Using PuTTY for GitHub SSH Authentication

1. Generate a public/private key using PuTTYgen.
2. Add the **public key** to GitHub account under SSH keys.
3. Configure PuTTY or Pageant to load the private key.
4. Now use Git over SSH securely from Windows.

### 5. Serial Console Access to Network Devices

Using a USB-to-serial cable, PuTTY can be used to access routers or switches.

* Choose **Serial** in connection type.
* Set COM port (e.g., COM3).
* Set baud rate (e.g., 9600).

Great for network engineers!

### 6. Running Telnet for Legacy Systems

While not secure, some legacy systems still use Telnet.

* Choose Telnet as the protocol.
* Enter host and port.

## Best Practices

* Always use SSH over Telnet for secure communication.
* Convert `.pem` to `.ppk` only on trusted machines.
* Store `.ppk` files securely, ideally encrypted.
* Use PuTTY session profiles for repeatable access.
* Automate file transfers with `pscp` for CI/CD.
* Keep PuTTY and PuTTYgen updated.

## Anti-Patterns

* Using Telnet over public networks
* Storing `.ppk` files in shared locations
* Hardcoding IP addresses in session without DNS or alias
* Sharing private keys across users
* Disabling host key verification

## Recommended Book

> **"SSH Mastery: OpenSSH, PuTTY, Tunnels and Keys" by Michael W. Lucas**

This book offers in-depth SSH knowledge and practical usage with tools like PuTTY. Perfect for developers and sysadmins.

## Final Thoughts

PuTTY may look simple, but it's a battle-tested tool that has saved countless hours for developers and operations teams
worldwide. Especially when working across platforms or connecting to cloud environments, it provides the reliability and
customization needed to securely access your servers.

Whether you're debugging a failed deployment, transferring files, or configuring a switch in a data center—PuTTY is a
friend you can trust.

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.

Happy coding :grinning:
