It was 2 AM. Our production monitoring system fired a high-priority alert. The billing microservice was down, and
nothing was being processed. The fix seemed straightforward — just update a configuration value. But every change caused
another test to fail. Digging deeper, we realized: changing one service unknowingly broke others. All because they were
tightly **coupled** in ways we hadn’t expected.

## The Incident

Our team had designed the system with a shared library for constants, DTOs, and logging. Over time, this library grew to
contain not just utility code, but business logic. When we made a small change in this shared code, ripple effects broke
logging in the auth service, changed validation in billing, and corrupted data sent to analytics. Services that seemed
unrelated were actually deeply entangled.

## The Problem

**Coupling** is the degree of interdependence between software modules. The more coupled your modules, the less you can
change one without impacting others. Tight coupling reduces flexibility, increases the cost of change, and makes the
system fragile.

Many developers unintentionally introduce coupling by:

* Sharing too much code (e.g., massive utility classes)
* Overusing inheritance
* Relying on global states
* Making implicit assumptions across components

## The Solution

To design robust systems, we need to recognize and reduce unnecessary coupling. We do this by:

* Understanding different types of coupling
* Practicing high cohesion and low coupling
* Applying SOLID principles and clean architecture

Let’s explore detailed examples of coupling at various levels.

## Detailed Examples of Coupling

### Coupling Between Classes

**Tight coupling:**

```java
class InvoiceService {
    private EmailSender emailSender = new EmailSender();

    public void sendInvoice() {
        emailSender.send();
    }
}
```

Here, `InvoiceService` is tightly coupled to `EmailSender`.

**Solution: Use abstraction**

```java
class InvoiceService {
    private final Notifier notifier;

    public InvoiceService(Notifier notifier) {
        this.notifier = notifier;
    }

    public void sendInvoice() {
        notifier.notify();
    }
}
```

Now we can inject any notifier: email, SMS, or a mock for testing.

### Method-Level Coupling

**Problem:** One method changes, and another breaks due to shared hidden state.

```java
public class UserService {
    private User currentUser;

    public void authenticate(String token) {
        this.currentUser = findUserByToken(token);
    }

    public void updateProfile(Profile profile) {
        currentUser.update(profile); // currentUser might be null
    }
}
```

**Solution:** Avoid hidden state, pass parameters explicitly.

```java
public void updateProfile(User user, Profile profile) {
    user.update(profile);
}
```

### Component-Level Coupling

In a monolith:

```java
OrderService -->PaymentService -->ShippingService
```

Any change in `PaymentService` API breaks both `OrderService` and `ShippingService`.

**Solution:** Introduce interfaces and isolate responsibilities.
Use a facade or event-based communication.

### Coupling in Distributed Systems

**Problem:** Two services are coupled by synchronous REST calls.

```java
InventoryService calls
PricingService for
every product
listed
```

If `PricingService` is slow or down, `InventoryService` fails.

**Solution:**

* Use **asynchronous messaging** (e.g., Kafka)
* Apply **circuit breakers** and **fallbacks**
* Prefer **event-driven** communication

### Coupling Through Database Schemas

When multiple services access the same database or table, a schema change can break unrelated services.

**Solution:**

* Isolate schemas per service (Database per Service pattern)
* Use APIs or events for communication, not shared tables

## Best Practices to Manage Coupling

1. **Prefer composition over inheritance**
2. **Use interfaces and dependency injection**
3. **Avoid global state and static utility classes**
4. **Apply SOLID principles (especially the Dependency Inversion Principle)**
5. **Design for change: favor loose coupling and high cohesion**
6. **Communicate via events in distributed systems**
7. **Encapsulate volatile areas behind abstractions**

## Final Thoughts

Coupling is inevitable — the key is to manage it wisely. Recognizing the types of coupling in your codebase gives you
control. The more loosely coupled your system, the more easily it adapts to change, scales, and remains maintainable
over time.

## Summary

* Coupling is the degree of interdependence between components.
* Tight coupling increases fragility and reduces flexibility.
* Loose coupling enables change, testing, and better system design.
* Tackle coupling at all levels: methods, classes, components, and systems.
* Use best practices like dependency injection, abstraction, and asynchronous communication.

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.  
Happy architecture :grinning:
