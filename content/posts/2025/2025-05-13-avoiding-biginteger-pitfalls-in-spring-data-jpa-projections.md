Every real-world development experience teaches us something beyond the documentation. This post is about one such
subtle yet enlightening incident I encountered while working with **Spring Data JPA projections** and **MySQL BIGINT**
types. This is a short story about how a small type mismatch led to an unexpected runtime errorâ€”and what I learned from
it.

## The Development Story

I was developing a feature that required fetching only a few selected fields from the database using **Spring Data JPA
interface-based projections**. One of the fields was the primary keyâ€”`id`, which is of type `BIGINT` in MySQL.

To keep things simple and lightweight, I defined the projection with `Long getId();`. Everything compiled fine, and the
initial query worked without any issues.

Later, I needed to fetch related data based on those IDs using another query that used a **DTO constructor projection**. 
I passed the IDs obtained from the first query into this second one, expecting a seamless transition. But then... ðŸ’¥

## The Problem

Suddenly, I got this error:

```java
java.lang.ClassCastException: java.math.BigInteger cannot be cast to java.lang.Long
```

At first, it was confusing. I had defined the projection method as `Long getId();` and the database column was `BIGINT`,
so where was the `BigInteger` coming from?

After debugging, I found the root cause:  
ðŸ‘‰ **Interface-based projections donâ€™t always perform type conversion the way entity mappings do**.

Spring Data JPA was fetching the value as a **`BigInteger`** (because it's a raw native query or sometimes due to how
the JPA provider maps scalar results), but my projection interface expected a `Long`. Unlike entity field mappings,
Hibernate doesn't do automatic conversion in interface-based projections.

## The Solution

To resolve this, I decided to:

- Replace the interface-based projection with a **constructor-based DTO projection** for **both** queries.
- Create explicit DTOs and let Hibernate map fields by constructor, which ensures that proper type conversion (e.g.,
  `BigInteger` to `Long`) happens automatically.

This change removed the casting issue and made the entire data flow clean and consistent.

## Example

### Original Interface-based Projection

```java
public interface UserIdProjection {
    Long getId();  // Problematic: may receive BigInteger from native queries
}
```

### DTO Projection (Working Version)

```java
public class UserIdDto {
    private final Long id;

    public UserIdDto(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
```

### Repository Query

```java

@Query("SELECT new com.example.dto.UserIdDto(u.id) FROM User u WHERE u.active = true")
List<UserIdDto> findActiveUserIds();
```

This approach ensures the `id` is properly converted to `Long`, as Hibernate handles the conversion when populating the
constructor parameters.

## Summary

Hereâ€™s what I learned from this incident:

- Interface-based projections in Spring Data JPA may not perform automatic type conversions.
- Native queries and some JPQLs might return `BigInteger` for `BIGINT` columns.
- Constructor-based DTO projections are more reliable when exact type matching is important.
- Avoid relying too heavily on Spring's "magic" in critical data transformation scenariosâ€”explicit DTOs can be more
  predictable.

## Final Thoughts

This experience reminded me how important it is to understand the underlying behavior of frameworks we use daily. What
seems like a minor implementation detail can cause real headaches if weâ€™re not careful.

Always question the defaults and consider using explicit DTOsâ€”especially when type safety and conversions matter.

Happy debugging :grinning:
