## Introduction

As a software developer, I’m always on the lookout for blogs that go beyond surface-level tutorials and really dive into
the craft of building software. Whether it's system design, clean code, DevOps, performance, or insights from industry
veterans, these blogs have consistently helped me grow as a developer.

This is a curated list of technical blogs that I personally find insightful, reliable, and worth following. They're not
just about code—they’re about how to think like an engineer.

## Recommended Technical Blogs

- **[Enterprise Craftsmanship](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/)**  
  Written by Vladimir Khorikov, this blog focuses on high-quality software development practices, especially around
  Domain-Driven Design, functional programming, and enterprise software architecture. In recent years, Vladimir has
  become a leading voice on making unit testing practical and painless. He shares insights from his experience authoring
  Pluralsight courses and writing a book on unit testing. A must-read for developers who care about clean architecture
  and sustainable codebases.

## Final Thoughts

These blogs represent a variety of perspectives and specializations in software development. I’ll be updating this list
regularly as I come across more valuable resources. If you have recommendations, feel free to reach out!
