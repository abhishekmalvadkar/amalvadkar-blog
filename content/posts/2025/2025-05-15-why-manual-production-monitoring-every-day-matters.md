It was a regular Wednesday morning. Our team received a panicked message: “Orders are dropping drastically—are we down?”
Yet, all our automated dashboards showed green. CPU load: normal. Error rates: low. Latency: healthy. Everything looked
perfect—until we checked the logs manually. What we saw was shocking.

## The Incident

A silent bug had been deployed the previous night. It didn’t cause exceptions or crash servers—it just swallowed user
inputs under specific conditions. Payments went through, but orders weren't being placed. Our dashboards, which
monitored infrastructure metrics, didn’t catch this subtle failure. It took us six hours to identify the root cause. We
lost revenue, user trust, and a bit of our engineering pride.

## The Problem

Automated monitoring tools are excellent at catching what they're programmed to watch. But they often miss the **unknown
unknowns**—the bugs that don't crash your system but still damage the user experience or business logic. Dashboards are
only as good as the assumptions behind them. And over time, teams become overly reliant on automation.

## The Solution: Manual Monitoring – 10 to 15 Minutes Every Day

Introducing a simple, discipline-based practice: **Spend 10–15 minutes every day manually monitoring your production
environment.** This doesn't replace automated monitoring—it complements it. It brings human intuition into the equation.

Check things your dashboards might miss:

* Open the site or app and go through a common user flow.
* Look at recent logs for errors or warnings.
* Check database tables for unusual data patterns.
* Review job queues and retry patterns.
* Observe trends, not just values.

## Examples in Detail

### Example 1: Spotting a Misconfigured Cron Job

A developer noticed that a weekly analytics report email had not been sent in two weeks. The cron job was misconfigured
after a deploy. No alert was triggered because the job didn’t fail—it just didn’t run. Manual review of the job logs
surfaced the issue.

### Example 2: Discovering a Broken Payment Flow

An engineer was performing daily manual monitoring and tried to buy a product with a test card. The transaction failed
silently. The logs showed a new validation rule had been deployed that blocked the transaction, but only for a specific
region. Dashboards didn’t flag this because the errors were below threshold.

### Example 3: Catching Data Quality Issues

A quick look at a "daily orders" report during a manual check revealed an unusual dip. The automated alert threshold was
set too low. Upon digging, it was discovered that a third-party API used for order validation was intermittently timing
out.

## Best Practices

* **Schedule it:** Do it every morning before starting deep work.
* **Create a checklist:** Standardize what to review—logs, reports, queues, transactions.
* **Involve team rotation:** Let different developers take turns—fresh eyes spot new things.
* **Document findings:** Keep a shared log of daily checks, even if nothing is found.
* **Improve automation based on findings:** Use what you learn to update alerts and dashboards.

## Final Thoughts

In the age of automation, we often forget the power of **intentional, mindful observation.** Manual monitoring for just
10–15 minutes each day can uncover hidden problems, validate assumptions, and ultimately strengthen the reliability of
your systems. It’s not about replacing tools—it’s about staying human in the loop.

## Summary

* Dashboards don’t catch every issue.
* Unknown unknowns often slip through automated cracks.
* Manual checks bring human intuition and pattern recognition.
* A small daily habit can prevent major production incidents.
* Use manual insights to improve your automation.

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.  
Happy monitoring :grinning:
