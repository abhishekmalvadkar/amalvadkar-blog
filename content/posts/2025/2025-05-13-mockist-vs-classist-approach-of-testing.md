In software development, testing is critical for ensuring that code works as expected. Over the years, there have been
different approaches to writing tests, with two popular ones being Mockist and Classist testing. These approaches
determine how we structure and design tests, with each having its advantages and disadvantages. Choosing between the two
can be challenging, especially when the test suite grows in size and complexity.

During a project in my early days of development, I encountered this dilemma. I was part of a team that was
transitioning from writing minimal tests to developing a comprehensive test suite. We were debating whether to use mocks
or prefer testing the real classes directly. This is when I first stumbled upon the Mockist vs. Classist debate.

## Story During Development

The team had been working on a complex feature, integrating multiple components that depended on each other. We began
writing unit tests for these components. At first, we thought it would be easier to mock dependencies and test
individual components in isolation (Mockist approach). However, we quickly realized that it was difficult to maintain
tests when the real classes were so tightly coupled with the mocks.

This led to discussions about the Classist approach, where we decided to test the actual classes and their behavior.
While this approach seemed like a better fit in some cases, it introduced more complexity when it came to integration
with external services and third-party libraries.

## Problem

The main problem in this case was finding a balance between testing with mocks (Mockist) and testing with real classes (
Classist). We faced the following challenges:

- **Tight coupling** with the mocked dependencies made the tests difficult to maintain and update.
- **Classist testing** sometimes led to tests that were too large or slow due to the need to involve all real
  dependencies.
- We weren’t sure which approach would give us better code coverage and, more importantly, ensure that our code was both
  functional and easy to maintain.

## Solution

After much debate, we decided that the solution would be a balanced approach. Here's what we concluded:

- **Mockist Testing:** Use this approach when testing individual components that interact with many external
  dependencies (e.g., external APIs, services). Mocking dependencies can speed up testing and isolate the behavior of
  the component.
- **Classist Testing:** Use this approach when testing core business logic that doesn’t have a lot of external
  dependencies, or when you want to ensure that the actual interactions between components are tested (i.e., integration
  testing).

In the end, the key was knowing when to mock and when to test the real classes. This was a case of context-driven
testing, where the problem itself guided the choice of the testing style.

## Example

Here’s an example to illustrate both approaches:

### Mockist Testing Example:

```java

@Test
public void shouldProcessPaymentWhenOrderIsValid() {
    OrderService orderService = mock(OrderService.class);
    PaymentGateway paymentGateway = mock(PaymentGateway.class);

    Order order = new Order(100);
    when(orderService.getOrder(100)).thenReturn(order);
    when(paymentGateway.processPayment(order)).thenReturn(true);

    PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor = new PaymentProcessor(orderService, paymentGateway);
    boolean result = paymentProcessor.processPayment(100);

    assertTrue(result);
}
```

### Classist Testing Example:

```java

@Test
public void shouldProcessPaymentWhenOrderIsValid() {
    Order order = new Order(100);
    PaymentGateway paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway();
    OrderService orderService = new OrderService(paymentGateway);

    boolean result = orderService.processPayment(order);

    assertTrue(result);
}
```

In the Mockist example, we mock the external dependencies (OrderService and PaymentGateway), while in the Classist
example, we directly test the integration of the components.

## Summary

To summarize, the Mockist vs. Classist debate boils down to how you choose to structure your tests. Mockist testing is
useful for isolating components and testing specific behaviors, while Classist testing ensures that the actual class
behavior is tested in its entirety, including interactions between components.

- Mockist testing can be ideal when you need to isolate dependencies or when dealing with external systems.

- Classist testing is better suited for testing full workflows and the actual logic of the system.

Choosing between the two depends on the project, the complexity of the system, and the goal of the tests.

## Final Thoughts

In my experience, it's important to use both approaches wisely. While Mockist testing helps in isolating dependencies
and making tests faster, overusing mocks can lead to tests that don't reflect real-world behavior. On the other hand,
Classist testing helps ensure that all components work together as expected, but it can be more time-consuming due to
dependencies.

Ultimately, finding a balance between these approaches is key to ensuring that your tests are effective and
maintainable. The best practice is to evaluate the situation and choose the approach that aligns with the goals of the
specific test case.
