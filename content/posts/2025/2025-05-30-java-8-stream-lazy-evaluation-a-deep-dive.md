It was a typical Monday morning stand-up when one of our junior developers, Ramesh, reported a strange bug: the
application wasn’t filtering or transforming data in a stream pipeline as expected. Everyone looked puzzled. The code
looked clean:

```java
List<String> result = list.stream()
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith("A"))
        .map(String::toUpperCase);
```

But Ramesh forgot the terminal operation!

This incident sparked a 30-minute conversation about Java 8 Streams and their *lazy evaluation* behavior. Most
developers had heard the term, but few truly understood what it meant and how it could impact our programs — both
positively and negatively.

## Problem

Developers coming from imperative backgrounds often expect every line of code to execute in order. This mindset leads to
confusion when streams behave lazily.

Without a terminal operation, nothing happens. This results in bugs that are hard to trace:

```java
list.stream()
    .filter(s -> s.startsWith("A"))
    .map(String::toUpperCase); // No terminal operation — pipeline never executes!
```

The result? No filtering, no mapping, no exception if a lambda throws, and no processing. The code *looks* fine but does
*nothing*.

## Solution

Java 8 Streams use lazy evaluation to improve performance and resource management. This means intermediate operations
like `filter`, `map`, or `sorted` are not executed until a terminal operation (like `collect`, `forEach`, `count`) is
invoked.

This design allows Java Streams to:

* Avoid unnecessary computation
* Short-circuit processing
* Optimize pipelines internally

To make the stream execute, always end with a terminal operation:

```java
List<String> result = list.stream()
        .filter(s -> s.startsWith("A"))
        .map(String::toUpperCase)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## Multiple Examples in Detail

### 1. Stream without Terminal Operation

```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Angela");

names.stream()
    .filter(name -> {
        System.out.println("Filtering: "+name);
        return name.startsWith("A");
});
```

**Output:** Nothing!

Because there's no terminal operation, `filter` never runs.

### 2. Stream with Terminal Operation

```java
List<String> result = names.stream()
        .filter(name -> {
            System.out.println("Filtering: " + name);
            return name.startsWith("A");
        })
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**Output:**

```shell
Filtering: Alice
Filtering: Bob
Filtering: Angela
```

Now the pipeline runs as expected.

### 3. Short-Circuiting with `findFirst()`

```java
Optional<String> first = names.stream()
        .filter(name -> {
            System.out.println("Filtering: " + name);
            return name.startsWith("A");
        })
        .findFirst();
```

**Output:**

```shell
Filtering: Alice
```

Only one item is evaluated because `findFirst()` short-circuits the stream.

### 4. Infinite Streams with `limit()`

```java
Stream<Integer> infinite = Stream.iterate(1, n -> n + 1);

List<Integer> limited = infinite
        .filter(n -> {
            System.out.println("Filtering: " + n);
            return n % 2 == 0;
        })
        .limit(5)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

**Output:** Filters and collects just 5 even numbers from an infinite stream — thanks to lazy evaluation!

## Best Practices

* Always end streams with terminal operations.
* Leverage short-circuiting operations (`limit`, `anyMatch`, `findFirst`) for performance.
* Avoid side effects in intermediate operations.
* Use `peek()` for debugging but not production logic.

## Anti-Patterns

* **Expecting execution without terminal operation**:

  ```java
  stream.map(...).filter(...); // NO terminal op — nothing happens
  ```

* **Using `forEach` as the only terminal operation when collecting is more suitable**:

  ```java
  list.stream().forEach(System.out::println); // Prefer collect if building a list
  ```

* **Heavy operations in intermediate steps without short-circuiting**:
  Expensive logic in `map` without early termination wastes CPU cycles.

## Final Thoughts

Lazy evaluation is one of the most powerful yet misunderstood aspects of Java Streams. It can save memory, boost
performance, and simplify code — but only when used with a full understanding of its behavior.

Treat your stream pipelines like a blueprint — they don’t *build* anything until you *tell* them to with a terminal
operation.

## Summary

* Java Streams are lazily evaluated.
* Intermediate operations (`map`, `filter`) don’t execute until a terminal operation (`collect`, `forEach`) is called.
* This allows for optimization and short-circuiting.
* Forgetting terminal operations leads to no execution.
* Understanding this is key to using Java 8 Streams effectively.

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.

Happy coding :grinning:
