It was a regular sprint planning meeting. We were working on a Spring Boot-based HRMS (Human Resource Management
System), and things were going smoothlyâ€”until the QA team reported a significant slowdown in loading the employee
attendance module. At first, we suspected network latency or some inefficient query.

Upon deeper inspection, we found something surprising: our MySQL `attendance_logs` table had grown to over **200 million
rows**. Every login, logout, biometric punchâ€”even failed attemptsâ€”were being logged without any purging strategy in
place. The system had been live for three years and had never archived or deleted old data.

This one incident led to performance degradation, increased storage costs, and eventually a midnight hotfix involving
emergency archiving scripts.

That incident made me realizeâ€”**data retention and purging is not just a backend concern, it's a core part of system
design.**

## Problem

In modern applications, data is continuously generated:

* Logs
* Audit trails
* Historical transactions
* Notifications
* Temporary states

Without a proper data eviction or retention policy:

* **Database performance degrades**
* **Storage costs balloon**
* **Backups take longer**
* **Application behavior becomes unpredictable**
* **Legal or compliance violations may occur (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)**

Yet, most developers skip this step until it's too late.

## Solution

Design and implement a **data retention and purging strategy** as a first-class citizen in your architecture. Hereâ€™s how
you can approach it in a Java Spring Boot application backed by MySQL:

## Examples in Detail

### 1. Define Retention Requirements

For each table or data type, ask:

* How long do we need to keep this data?
* Is it business-critical?
* Is there a legal requirement to retain it?
* Can we archive it?

Example:

```java
// Attendance logs: Keep 1 year, archive older
// Audit logs: Keep 2 years
// Email notifications: Keep 3 months
```

### 2. Schema Design with TTL in Mind

Avoid mixing long-term and short-lived data in the same table.

**Bad:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_actions (
  id BIGINT,
  user_id INT,
  action_type VARCHAR(50),
  timestamp DATETIME
);
```

**Better:**
Separate into:

* `user_audit_logs`
* `temporary_user_actions`

This makes purging easier and reduces risk.

### 3. Implement Scheduled Purging

Use Springâ€™s `@Scheduled` annotation or Quartz to schedule deletion or archiving jobs.

```java

@Scheduled(cron = "0 0 2 * * ?") // Every day at 2 AM
@Transactional
public void purgeOldAttendanceLogs() {
    LocalDate cutoff = LocalDate.now().minusYears(1);
    attendanceRepository.deleteByTimestampBefore(cutoff);
}
```

Or use native SQL for large batch deletes:

```java

@Modifying
@Query("DELETE FROM AttendanceLog a WHERE a.timestamp < :cutoff")
void deleteOlderThan(@Param("cutoff") LocalDate cutoff);
```

### 4. Soft Deletes and Archival

Sometimes deletion isn't allowed. Archive data instead:

```sql
INSERT INTO attendance_logs_archive
SELECT * FROM attendance_logs WHERE timestamp < '2023-06-01';

DELETE FROM attendance_logs WHERE timestamp < '2023-06-01';
```

You can use Spring Batch or Flyway scripts for bulk archival.

### 5. Partitioning for Better Performance

If tables are huge, consider **MySQL Partitioning**:

```sql
PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(timestamp)) (
  PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
  PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025)
);
```

Then drop the old partition:

```sql
ALTER TABLE attendance_logs DROP PARTITION p2023;
```

### 6. Legal Compliance

Ensure compliance with:

* **GDPR**: Right to be forgotten.
* **HIPAA**: Minimum necessary data.
* **Financial laws**: Minimum retention periods.

Make retention part of the data policy design.

## Best Practices

* **Design tables with eviction in mind**
* **Separate frequently purged data from core business data**
* **Use batch processing for large purging jobs**
* **Use `LIMIT` with `DELETE` to avoid long locks**
* **Test retention jobs on staging with a copy of production data**
* **Log and alert on purge success/failure**
* **Document retention policies**

## Anti-Patterns

* Storing all logs in a single monolithic table forever
* Relying on manual SQL scripts for purging
* No backups before purge
* Using cascading deletes carelesslyâ€”risking important data
* No legal review on what data can be deleted

* *Clean Architecture* by Robert C. Martin
* *Database Internals* by Alex Petrov

## Final Thoughts

Data retention should be intentional, strategic, and automated. Just like you write unit tests or design APIs, you
should plan for how data exits your system. Because if you donâ€™t manage old data, it **will** manage you.

That HRMS incident? We later made purging part of our DOR (Definition of Ready). Every time a new feature generates
data, we ask: *How long do we keep it?*

**Retention is not just about cleanupâ€”it's about control.**

## Summary

* Data grows rapidly in modern systems
* Without eviction, performance and cost suffer
* Retention strategies should be part of system design
* Use Spring Boot schedulers, MySQL techniques, and archival systems
* Always test, document, and automate retention policies
