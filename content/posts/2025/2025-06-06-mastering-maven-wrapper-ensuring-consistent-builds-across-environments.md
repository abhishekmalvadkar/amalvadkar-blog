It was a Friday evening. The team was wrapping up for the week when a new member tried to build the Java project from
his freshly set-up machine. He cloned the repo, ran `mvn clean install`, and immediately hit a version mismatch error.
He had Maven 3.9 installed, while the project was written and verified using Maven 3.6.3. Minor version differences led
to plugin incompatibilities and failed builds. This wasn't the first time. The dev lead sighed and said, "Let’s add the
Maven Wrapper."

This small but powerful tool, often overlooked, can save hours of debugging and ensure consistency across environments.
In this blog, we’ll explore Maven Wrapper in depth.

## Problem

When working on Java projects across a team, everyone may have different versions of Maven installed. This leads to
various issues:

* Build failures due to version mismatch
* Inconsistencies in plugin behavior
* Onboarding friction for new developers
* CI/CD environments relying on installed versions

These problems arise because the project does not enforce a specific Maven version. While specifying it in documentation
is helpful, it’s not enforceable. That’s where the Maven Wrapper helps.

## Solution

**Maven Wrapper** is a way to ensure that anyone cloning your project will use the exact Maven version you’ve
configured, without needing to install Maven manually.

It consists of a few files (scripts and a small Java bootstrapper) checked into your repository. When you run `./mvnw`
or `mvnw.cmd`, it downloads the specified Maven version and runs your build.

This solves the version mismatch problem entirely.

## Multiple Examples in Detailed Fashion with Explanation

### Example 1: Adding Maven Wrapper to a Project

Run the following command:

```bash
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
```

This adds the following files to your project:

```shell
.
├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
└── .mvn/
    └── wrapper/
        ├── maven-wrapper.jar
        └── maven-wrapper.properties
```

In `maven-wrapper.properties`, you’ll see something like:

```properties
distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.6.3/apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.zip
```

This controls the Maven version your project will use.

Now anyone can run:

```bash
./mvnw clean install
```

And Maven 3.6.3 will be used regardless of the system version.

### Example 2: Using the Wrapper in CI/CD

In CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions):

```yaml
- name: Build with Maven Wrapper
  run: ./mvnw clean install
```

You no longer need a step to install Maven or worry about version mismatch.

### Example 3: Upgrading the Maven Version

Just update the `distributionUrl` in `maven-wrapper.properties`:

```properties
distributionUrl=https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/apache/maven/apache-maven/3.9.0/apache-maven-3.9.0-bin.zip
```

Commit this change, and the new version will be used by everyone from that point on.

## Best Practices

* Always commit the `mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`, and `.mvn` folder to version control.
* Use the wrapper in your build scripts and documentation.
* Keep the Maven version consistent with your development and CI environments.
* Use wrapper even for internal libraries so that consumers don't have issues.

## Anti Patterns

* Ignoring wrapper scripts in `.gitignore`
* Assuming developers will install the correct Maven version manually
* Changing the wrapper version without testing the build pipeline
* Using wrapper but still referencing system Maven in documentation or scripts

## Recommended Book

While there is no dedicated book for Maven Wrapper, these resources cover Maven and build automation effectively:

* "Maven: The Definitive Guide" by Sonatype
* "Continuous Delivery" by Jez Humble and David Farley (covers build pipelines where wrapper is essential)

## Final Thoughts

Maven Wrapper might look like a minor addition, but its impact is significant in professional software development. From
onboarding to CI pipelines, it brings consistency and stability to your build process. In teams, where time is precious
and configuration errors are costly, this small investment pays off massively.

Start using it today, and you'll soon wonder how you managed without it.

## Summary

* Maven version mismatch causes build issues
* Maven Wrapper standardizes Maven across environments
* Easy to install with a single Maven command
* Reduces onboarding friction and improves CI reliability
* Should be a standard part of every Java project

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.

Happy coding
