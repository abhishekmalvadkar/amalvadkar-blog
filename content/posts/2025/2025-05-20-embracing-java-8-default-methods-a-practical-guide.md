It was a regular Tuesday morning. The development team had gathered for the daily standup. Jane, the team’s lead
developer, looked frustrated. "We need to add a new method to our `PaymentProcessor` interface," she said, "but we have
over 15 different implementations in production. If we touch that interface, we’ll break all of them."

Silence.

Everyone understood the challenge. Modifying an interface in Java before Java 8 was like tiptoeing through a minefield.
One small change could ripple across the codebase, causing a cascade of compile-time errors.

But then Mark, a new team member, raised his hand: "Can’t we use a default method in the interface?"

That one question changed the trajectory of the sprint.

## Problem

Before Java 8, interfaces in Java could only have abstract methods. If you wanted to add a new method to an existing
interface, every class implementing that interface had to implement the new method, even if the default behavior was the
same across most implementations.

This made interfaces rigid and hard to evolve. Especially in large codebases or frameworks, evolving an API meant
breaking changes and lots of manual work.

```java
public interface Printer {
    void print(String message);
}

// Now, you want to add a new method:
// void printHeader(String header);

// Every implementation will break unless you modify them.
```

## Solution: Default Methods in Interfaces

Java 8 introduced **default methods** to solve this very problem.

A **default method** is a method defined in an interface with a default implementation. This means that you can add new
methods to an interface without breaking the existing implementations.

```java
public interface Printer {
    void print(String message);

    default void printHeader(String header) {
        System.out.println("=== " + header + " ===");
    }
}
```

Now, existing implementations of `Printer` are not forced to override `printHeader`. They inherit the default behavior.

## Multiple Examples with Detailed Explanation

### Example 1: Evolving an Interface Safely

```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void processPayment(double amount);

    default void auditPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Auditing payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

public class CreditCardProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing credit card payment: $" + amount);
    }
}

public class PayPalProcessor implements PaymentProcessor {
    public void processPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Processing PayPal payment: $" + amount);
    }

    @Override
    public void auditPayment(double amount) {
        System.out.println("Custom PayPal audit for: $" + amount);
    }
}
```

Here:

* `CreditCardProcessor` inherits the default `auditPayment`.
* `PayPalProcessor` provides its own implementation.

### Example 2: Using Default Methods to Share Utility Code

```java
public interface StringUtils {
    default String capitalize(String input) {
        if (input == null || input.isEmpty()) return input;
        return Character.toUpperCase(input.charAt(0)) + input.substring(1);
    }
}

public class NameFormatter implements StringUtils {
    public String formatName(String name) {
        return capitalize(name.trim());
    }
}
```

In this case, `capitalize` is shared across any class implementing `StringUtils`, avoiding code duplication.

### Example 3: Multiple Inheritance of Behavior

```java
interface InterfaceA {
    default void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from A");
    }
}

interface InterfaceB {
    default void greet() {
        System.out.println("Hello from B");
    }
}

class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    @Override
    public void greet() {
        InterfaceA.super.greet(); // or InterfaceB.super.greet();
    }
}
```

Here, the compiler forces you to resolve the conflict when two interfaces define the same default method.

### Real Use Case: Spring Data JPA Repository

One practical use case of default methods is with Spring Data JPA repositories. Suppose you want to add some common
behavior to all your repositories.

You can create a base interface with default methods and let all your repository interfaces extend it:

```java

@NoRepositoryBean
public interface BaseRepository<T, ID extends Serializable> extends JpaRepository<T, ID> {

    default void softDelete(T entity) {
        if (entity instanceof SoftDeletable) {
            ((SoftDeletable) entity).setDeleted(true);
        }
    }
}

public interface UserRepository extends BaseRepository<User, Long> {
    // inherits softDelete() with default behavior
}
```

In this case, the `softDelete` method can be shared across repositories without repeating code. Entities implementing
`SoftDeletable` can be handled uniformly.

This is especially useful in enterprise applications where certain behaviors like auditing, soft deletes, or status
flags need to be enforced consistently.

### Real Use Case: findById with Exception Handling in Repository Interface

Let’s say in many places of your application you need to fetch an entity by ID, and if not found, throw a
`NotFoundException`. Instead of repeating this logic everywhere, you can define a default method in your base
repository:

```java

@NoRepositoryBean
public interface BaseRepository<T, ID extends Serializable> extends JpaRepository<T, ID> {

    default T findByIdOrThrow(ID id, Supplier<? extends RuntimeException> exceptionSupplier) {
        return findById(id).orElseThrow(exceptionSupplier);
    }

    default T findByIdOrThrow(ID id) {
        return findByIdOrThrow(id, () -> new NotFoundException("Entity not found with id: " + id));
    }
}
```

Usage in service:

```java
Product product = productRepository.findByIdOrThrow(productId);
```

Or with custom exception:

```java
Product product = productRepository.findByIdOrThrow(productId, () -> new ProductNotFoundException(productId));
```

This approach eliminates repetitive null checks and exception-throwing logic across services, making your codebase more
expressive and DRY.

## Best Practices

* **Use default methods to evolve APIs without breaking backward compatibility.**
* **Use default methods for utility or helper logic related to the interface.**
* **Override default methods in implementations where specific behavior is required.**
* **Document default methods clearly to avoid confusion.**
* **Use them in shared interfaces like Spring Data JPA base repositories to promote consistency.**

## Anti-Patterns

* **Don’t use default methods to write complex logic.** Keep them simple.
* **Avoid stateful behavior in default methods.** Interfaces are not meant to manage state.
* **Don’t abuse default methods to simulate mixins or multiple inheritance.**
* **Avoid method name conflicts across interfaces unless absolutely necessary.**

## Final Thoughts

Default methods are a powerful feature in Java 8 that bring flexibility to interface design. They allow developers to
add new behavior to interfaces without breaking existing code, which is especially useful in library or API development.
However, like any powerful feature, they must be used judiciously. Overusing them or misusing them can lead to confusing
and tightly coupled code.

When used correctly, default methods make codebases more maintainable and interfaces more expressive.

## Summary

* Java 8 introduced default methods to allow adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
* They provide a way to define behavior in interfaces.
* Use them to evolve APIs, provide shared utilities, or supply common default logic.
* Avoid overcomplicating them or using them for stateful or unrelated logic.
* They shine in real-world use cases like Spring Data JPA shared repositories.
