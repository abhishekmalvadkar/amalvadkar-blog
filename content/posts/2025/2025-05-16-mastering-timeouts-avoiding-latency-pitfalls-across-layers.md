It was a quiet production day—until it wasn’t.

A seemingly innocent feature went live, and within minutes, the application dashboard turned red. Threads were stuck,
CPU spiked, and users saw endless loading spinners. After hours of debugging, we discovered a database query was waiting
endlessly due to a missing timeout configuration.

This incident exposed how fragile systems become when timeouts are not explicitly defined or coordinated across
application layers. From the web server to the database, every component must handle delays gracefully.

## Problem: Timeout Chaos

Timeouts are safeguards. Without them, a system can:

* Hang indefinitely, consuming resources.
* Cause thread starvation.
* Trigger cascading failures across services.

Many developers wrongly assume defaults are good enough, leading to brittle systems under load. Worse, inconsistent
timeout values across layers can result in partial timeouts—like a client timing out after 10 seconds while the backend
is still processing.

## Solution: Coordinated Timeout Strategy

Define and configure timeouts at every level:

1. Web Server (e.g., Tomcat)
2. Connection Pool (e.g., HikariCP)
3. Spring Transaction Management
4. SQL Query Execution
5. External API Calls
6. Thread Pools
7. Async Operations (CompletableFuture, Reactor)

And more importantly, ensure these timeouts are consistent with each other, preferably with a central strategy or
configuration.

## Examples and Detailed Explanations

### 1. Tomcat Server Timeout

```properties
# application.properties
server.tomcat.connection-timeout=5000 # 5 seconds
```

**Explanation**: This controls how long Tomcat waits for a client to send data after a connection is established.
Without this, idle connections can linger.

### 2. HikariCP Connection Pool Timeout

```properties
spring.datasource.hikari.connection-timeout=3000 # 3 seconds
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=10
```

**Explanation**: Controls how long the pool will wait to get a DB connection. If all connections are in use, a thread
will wait for this timeout before throwing an exception.

### 3. Spring Transaction Timeout

```java

@Transactional(timeout = 5) // 5 seconds
public void processOrder() {
    // DB logic
}
```

**Explanation**: If the transaction runs longer than 5 seconds, Spring will roll it back.

### 4. JPA / Hibernate Query Timeout

```java

@PersistenceContext
private EntityManager em;

public List<Order> findSlowQuery() {
    return em.createQuery("SELECT o FROM Order o")
            .setHint("javax.persistence.query.timeout", 2000) // 2 seconds
            .getResultList();
}
```

**Explanation**: This is a per-query timeout enforced at the JDBC driver or database level.

### 5. JDBC Statement Timeout

```java
Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
stmt.

setQueryTimeout(3); // 3 seconds
```

**Explanation**: Ensures long-running SQL queries are interrupted.

### 6. RestTemplate Timeout

```java

@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory factory = new HttpComponentsClientHttpRequestFactory();
    factory.setConnectTimeout(3000);
    factory.setReadTimeout(5000);
    return new RestTemplate(factory);
}
```

**Explanation**: Connect timeout is the max time to establish the connection, read timeout is how long to wait for data.

### 7. WebClient Timeout (Reactor)

```java
WebClient client = WebClient.builder()
        .baseUrl("http://example.com")
        .clientConnector(new ReactorClientHttpConnector(
                HttpClient.create().responseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(5))
        ))
        .build();
```

**Explanation**: Timeout for a reactive HTTP client, ensuring reactive chains don’t hang.

### 8. CompletableFuture Timeout

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> someSlowTask())
.orTimeout(2,TimeUnit.SECONDS);
```

**Explanation**: Fails the future if it doesn’t complete in time.

## Best Practices

* **Align timeouts across layers**: Downstream timeouts should be slightly less than upstream.
* **Fail fast**: Don’t wait endlessly for resources.
* **Centralize timeout configs**: Use application.yaml or configuration classes.
* **Monitor and alert on timeouts**: Use logs, APM, or metrics.
* **Tune based on production traffic**: Adjust timeouts based on response time distributions.

## Anti-Patterns

* **Relying on defaults**: Most frameworks have high or infinite timeouts by default.
* **Mismatched timeouts**: If WebClient times out in 3s but DB in 10s, the request may abort while DB continues to
  execute.
* **Not retrying with backoff**: Blind retries on timeouts can overload the system.
* **Logging without limits**: Too many timeout logs can flood logs under load.

## Final Thoughts

Timeouts are not just knobs to tweak—they’re safety valves. Designing resilient applications means knowing where delays
can occur and failing gracefully when they do.

Properly configured timeouts are one of the cheapest forms of protection against cascading failures.

## Summary

```shell
| Layer                 | Property / Method                        | Default (Usually) | Recommended Example |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Tomcat                | `server.tomcat.connection-timeout`       | 20s+              | `5000` ms           |
| HikariCP              | `connection-timeout`                     | 30s               | `3000` ms           |
| Spring @Transactional | `@Transactional(timeout=...)`            | Infinite          | `5` sec             |
| JPA Query             | `javax.persistence.query.timeout`        | None              | `2000` ms           |
| JDBC Statement        | `stmt.setQueryTimeout()`                 | 0 (infinite)      | `3` sec             |
| RestTemplate          | `setConnectTimeout`, `setReadTimeout`    | Infinite          | 3s / 5s             |
| WebClient (Reactor)   | `responseTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(x))` | Infinite          | 5s                  |
| CompletableFuture     | `orTimeout()`                            | Infinite          | 2s                  |
```

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.  
Happy system design :grinning:
