It was a rainy Monday morning, and our team was deep in the middle of refactoring an old legacy codebase. Rahul, a
teammate, had just discovered a utility interface used in several modules. He wanted to add a new utility method without
affecting any implementing classes.

"Why not just use a static method inside the interface?" he asked.

"Wait, what? You can have static methods inside interfaces?" someone blurted out.

That day turned into a revelation for many in the team. Static methods in interfaces, a feature introduced in Java 8,
became the highlight of our refactoring session. It helped us decouple logic, encapsulate utilities, and write cleaner
code.

## Problem

Before Java 8, interfaces were limited to abstract method declarations. This meant:

* Utility methods shared across implementations had to be placed in separate utility classes.
* It was hard to group related static functionality with interfaces.
* Developers ended up creating awkward "Utils" classes, cluttering codebases.

This fragmentation created a mess. Logic that should have belonged to a domain-specific interface was being dumped into
scattered classes, increasing cognitive load and reducing cohesion.

## Solution

Java 8 introduced **static methods in interfaces**. With this enhancement, you can define static utility methods
directly inside the interface. These methods are:

* Not inherited by implementing classes
* Called using the interface name
* A great way to group related utility logic tightly coupled with the interface

This was a significant step toward **encapsulation** and **modularity**.

## Multiple Examples with Explanation

### Example 1: Static Validator in an Interface

```java
public interface EmailValidator {
    static boolean isValid(String email) {
        return email != null && email.contains("@") && email.endsWith(".com");
    }
}

public class EmailService {
    public void process(String email) {
        if (EmailValidator.isValid(email)) {
            System.out.println("Processing: " + email);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid email");
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* `isValid()` method is static and resides inside the interface itself.
* The method is not inherited but accessed via `EmailValidator.isValid()`.
* Great for encapsulating domain-specific validations.

### Example 2: Utility Methods in Functional Interfaces

```java

@FunctionalInterface
public interface MathOperation {
    int operate(int a, int b);

    static MathOperation add() {
        return (a, b) -> a + b;
    }

    static MathOperation multiply() {
        return (a, b) -> a * b;
    }
}

public class Calculator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int result = MathOperation.add().operate(5, 3);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Static methods `add()` and `multiply()` provide pre-configured implementations.
* This makes client code concise and declarative.

### Example 3: Grouping Formatters in an Interface

```java
public interface Formatter {
    static String toUpperCase(String input) {
        return input == null ? "" : input.toUpperCase();
    }

    static String trim(String input) {
        return input == null ? "" : input.trim();
    }
}

public class FormatterService {
    public void printFormatted(String input) {
        System.out.println(Formatter.toUpperCase(Formatter.trim(input)));
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

* Utility formatting logic is grouped logically inside the interface.
* Reduces the need for a separate `FormatterUtils` class.

## Best Practices

* **Encapsulation:** Only place static methods in interfaces if they are strongly related to that interface’s purpose.
* **Naming Clarity:** Use meaningful method names; these are not implementation details.
* **Avoid Bloat:** Don’t turn interfaces into dumping grounds for utilities—organize well.
* **Consistency:** If you're using static methods in one interface for a domain, consider using it similarly across
  others to maintain uniformity.

## Anti-Patterns

* **Inheritance Confusion:** Assuming static methods are inherited. They're not.
* **Interface Pollution:** Overloading interfaces with unrelated static methods.
* **Testing Pain:** Static methods can be hard to mock (unless using tools like PowerMock), so keep logic simple and
  testable.
* **Breaking SRP:** Cramming too much responsibility into an interface just because static methods are allowed.

## Final Thoughts

Static methods in interfaces might seem like a minor addition, but when used wisely, they lead to more cohesive and
maintainable designs. They offer a natural place to group domain-relevant utilities while preserving interface
contracts. Avoid abusing them, and you’ll find them immensely useful.

## Summary

* Java 8 allows static methods in interfaces.
* They’re useful for grouping utility methods relevant to the interface.
* They're not inherited by implementing classes.
* Used wisely, they promote clean design and encapsulation.
* Don’t misuse them by bloating your interfaces.

Happy coding :grinning:
