Technical quotes often capture deep wisdom, distilled from years of experience in software development, engineering, and
innovation. These quotes not only inspire us but also offer guiding principles and practical truths for navigating the
challenges of the tech world. Whether you're a developer, architect, or tech leader, these words can shape your mindset
and improve your craft. In this blog, I’ve compiled some of my favorite technical quotes, along with the names of their
authors and a short description of their significance. I will continue updating this list as I come across more
impactful quotes.

## Quotes

### 1. First make the change easy, then make the easy change

**Author:** Kent Beck

**Description:**  
In the context of refactoring, this quote means that before adding a new feature, we should first focus on making the
codebase flexible and easy to change. By simplifying or refactoring existing code, we reduce the complexity of adding
new functionality. Once the code is easier to modify, we can implement the new feature in a straightforward, less risky
way. This approach helps in avoiding large, complicated changes and makes the process smoother and more maintainable in
the long run.

## Final Thoughts

Great technical quotes serve as timeless mentors. They encapsulate valuable lessons in a few words and often become
mantras that guide our day-to-day work. As I discover more insightful quotes, I’ll continue adding them here. Feel free
to bookmark this post and revisit for fresh doses of technical wisdom.

That's it for today, will meet in next episode.

Happy motivation :grinning:
