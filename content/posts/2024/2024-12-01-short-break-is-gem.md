## Problem

In our daily life of coding we are working on very complex systems.

And somtimes we stuck and in that time nothing is working and in this case most of developers
are sticking to screen for a long time and trying to find solution of that not working thing, which we should not do.

Let's see what we should do in this situation where something is not working from long time trying.

## Solution

**Perform any one of the below:**

* Take a break.
* Have a walk.
* Take a nap.

I am saying this from my real experience where i was working on complex functionality where
things are not working as expected and I was trying from long time.

So I have decided to take break and when I came from break and tried for 2 mins and it worked.

**I was shocked with this trick.**

**Important Note:**

The magic of this trick is that when you come from break then your mind is fresh and that
fresh mind can see things that you previous frustrated mind not able to see it.
