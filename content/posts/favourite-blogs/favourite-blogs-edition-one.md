As a software developer, I’m always on the lookout for blogs that go beyond surface-level tutorials and really dive into
the craft of building software. Whether it's system design, clean code, DevOps, performance, or insights from industry
veterans, these blogs have consistently helped me grow as a developer.

This is a curated list of technical blogs that I personally find insightful, reliable, and worth following. They're not
just about code—they’re about how to think like an engineer.

## Recommended Technical Blogs
